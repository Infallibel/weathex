App that gets weather and exchange rates. Made as a practice app to strengthen API skills in flutter. 

App was made to look similarly to a display of weather and exchange rates (reduced by commissions) in one of the hotels in PL.

It fetched the data from accuweather and from NBP and displays it as a slideshow that is fully screened.

The only necessity with displaying the app is to turn off the 'sleep mode' as after that time the screen darkens and it may not be the desired outcome.
