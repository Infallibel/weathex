App that gets weather and exchange rates. Made as a practice app to strengthen API skills in flutter.

App was made to look similarly to a display of weather and exchange rates (reduced by commissions) in one of the hotels in PL.

It fetches the data from accuweather and from NBP and displays it as a slideshow that is full-screened.
